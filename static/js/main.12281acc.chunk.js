This followed a different process than most other projects because we had many rounds of UX/UI, user testing, and prototype tests. The idea was an application that exhibitors at a show could provide a QR code for guests to scan for more information digitally. This consisted of three parts, the CMS for exhibitors to add content and information, the front-end interface where anyone could preview and sign up, and finally the attendee portal where content would be saved and where it could be shared with others. Our first roll out was for Seatrade Cruise Global in the beginning 2019 then continued improving the application for Gartner to Go later in 2019 as well as a redeploy in 2021.
