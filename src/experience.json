    "description": "For the 2019 Boat Tour, we created the ‘Fishing for Premiums’ Mobile Experience where guests would control virtual fishing poles on dedicated mobile devices to try to virtually ‘catch’ the most fish during a timed experience. The project was built in vue.js communicating through an internal tool using sockets to a unity application. By using the phone’s gyroscope data we were able to simulate real fishing mechanics on the unity display. ",

    "description": "Content portal was a product a small team focused on developing that could be used at many different types of trade shows. This followed a different process than most other experience because we had many rounds of UX/UI, user testing, and different prototype tests. The idea was an application that exhibitors at a show could provide a QR code for guests to scan to get more information digitally. This consisted of three parts, the CMS for exhibitors to add content and information, the front-end interface where anyone could preview and sign up, and finally the attendee portal where content would be saved and where it could be shared with others. Our first roll out was for Seatrade Cruise Global in the beginning 2019 then continued improving the application for Gartner to Go later in 2019 as well as a redeploy in 2021. In 2020 we rolled it out for our parent company Freeman for Freeman Live. Originally build in React.js and later rebuilt using Vue.js.",
